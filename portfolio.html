                            <p>I have always wanted to own a portfolio website but building one with a customized template from WIX or other similar platforms wouldn’t be reasonable for a Computer Science student as we are taught to solve problems and innovate through codes. So, why not code it myself? </p>
                            <p>Having picked up HTML, CSS and Javascript from my Web & Development module, I thought this would be a great opportunity to put my skills and knowledge at good use.</p>

                      <p>During my preparation for internship application, I wonder what are some other ways that could allow the company to understand me better apart from the usual CV and Cover Letter submission. And here is my answer! A portfolio website that serves as a platform for me to showcase my personality, experience and my life - basically understanding me from a broader perspective. Thus, I will need 3 main pages for this. A page to describe myself, a page to showcase my previous work and experience and a page to introduce some interesting aspects of my life. </p>
                        <p>To kick start this design project, I started off with <span>moodboarding</span> to figure out what I would like to include in my website and to set a tone for my website.</p>

                    <div class="insights-text-2">
                        <p>I then proceed with producing the <span>wireframes</span> which act as a visual guide to what my website will look like in reality. I came out with a low-fidelity wireframe which was sketched by hand as well as a high-fidelity wireframe which was designed using figma.</p>

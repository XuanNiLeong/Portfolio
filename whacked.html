                            <p>Having worked on a software development project in my first year, I realised that I really enjoyed the collaborative working experience and the agile methodology that was implemented throughout the software development cycle. Besides, I am also interested in exploring entrepreneurship as I would like to gain insights on how to start and grow a startup. Thus, I looked into opportunities that will provide me the exposure as a Software Engineer intern working in a startup.</p>

                      <p>Interning in a start-up gives me the opportunity to be involved in almost every single phase of building the website. From planning and design all the way to development and maintenance, I handled the development of the website independently with regular support from my mentor.</p>
                      <p>Planning & Design : <br> Before I jump into coding, I had a requirement elicitation meeting with the co-founders to identify the mood and tone of the website as well as identifying the specific pages and call to actions that should be on the website. The team then had a collaborative art session to visualise the requirements by creating wireframes layout and prototype designs. </p>
                      <p>Development : <br> To bring the designs to real life, I used HTML, CSS, JS and PHP in my code. It was my first time developing an actual website in a professional manner and thus, there was a lot of researching, learning, reading documentation, watching youtube and testing involved in the development process. </p>
                      <p>Launch & Maintenance : <br> Apart from coding, I have also learnt to publish the website to the internet by learning about domain, domain name servers and IP address. Besides, I also stretched beyond my comfort zone by learning about the security issues of my website through installing SSL certification and Fail2Ban.</p>

                      <li><span>Data Analytics Software</span></li>
                      <p>Manual calculation and analysis of their clients current and past data is one of the challenges faced by the company. The team is currently working on building a data analytics dashboard that will record their clients’ current and past data, which can then be used to automatically visualise their clients’ progress through analysis of their data. For instance, the number of followers on LinkedIn, number of likes, number of views and more. </p>
                      <p>The product of the software will be updated here when mission is accomplished! Stay tuned!</p>
